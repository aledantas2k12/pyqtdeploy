This directory contains a simple widget-based demonstration application
(pyqt-demo.py) that will build on all supported target platforms.  When run it
displays various pieces of information about what is included in the
application.

The build-demo.py will first build a sysroot (using the specification in
sysroot.json) and then build the application itself.

The '--no-sysroot' option to build-demo.py will skip the creation of the
sysroot so that you can update and re-build pyqt-demo.py without having to
re-build sysroot each time.

By default build-demo.py will build a native application.  On macOS the
'--target' option can be used to build applications for iOS and Android.  It
should also be possible to build Android applications on Windows and Linux but
this isn't tested.

By default build-demo.py expects to find the source code for the different
components (Python, OpenSSL, Qt, SIP, PyQt etc.) in the directory 'src'.  The
'--sources' option can be used to specify a different directory.  For iOS and
Android targets the Qt installations (installed using the binary installers
from The Qt Company) must be in the same directory.
