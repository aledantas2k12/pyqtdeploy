========================================

The Command Line
----------------

:program:`pyqtdeploy` takes a single optional argument which is the name of a
project file to edit as follows::

    pyqtdeploy myproject.pdy

By convention project files have a ``.pdy`` extension.

This will open the ``myproject.pdy`` project creating it if necessary.
